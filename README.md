# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

The purpose of this project is to replicate designs using Flutter where you can customize widgets. 

I intend to create a BMI calculator which is inspired by the beautiful designs of [Kevin Al-Rizal](https://dribbble.com/shots/11368106-BMI-Calculator-App-Neumorphism). The design may not be mapped 1:1, but the assumptions are there.

- How to extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button. 
- How to pass functions as parameters and fields.
- How to use the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.

## Future Goals

- Creating an additional two panels from Kevin's design

- Connecting to sqlite and saving results to database
- Create slider from a scratch

## Additional information

The project would not have succeeded if not for Angela Yu's wonderful bootcamp. I encourage you to take it because it is very valuable.
